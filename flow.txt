What I need:

- Variables 
- If sentences 
- While loops
- Lists

There are three separate things that I want to accomplish in this game:
1) Choose the word I have to guess
2) Gather guesses and see if they are in the word
3) Create the hangman graphic

To make 'Python exam' Hangman:
- String for the real word
- list for the letters I am trying to guess
- string for the letter I am guessing
- A while loop that will let me guess until we're out of guesses or I want to end the game
- An integer counter for the allowed amount of guesses
